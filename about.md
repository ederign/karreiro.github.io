Hi, I'm Guilherme Carreiro, aka `karreiro` :-)

I work as a Software Engineer at Red Hat in the Drools project. Currently, I'm involved with the development of the DMN editor into the platform.

I love to program, to automate some everyday-task with a smart script, and to keep my workstation ***very*** neat ðŸ‘€

I'm also a home office advocate :flip-flops-emoji: and the Zelda number one fan :navi-emoji:

I would leave some social links here to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karreiro_), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karreiro), even my [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@karreiro) account, but most of the time I'm trying to open new PRs and review code on [GitHub](https://github.com/karreiro).
