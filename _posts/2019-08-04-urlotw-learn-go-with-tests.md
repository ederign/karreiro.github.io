**URLOTW** or **URL** **o**f **t**he **w**eek or **U**niform **R**esource **L**ocator **o**f **t**he **w**eek is a new type of post, where I share a relevant URL I discover during the week.

This week the winner is ***Learn Go with test-driven development*** ([https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests)).

It's is a super engaging tutorial, and I cannot stop reading it. It teaches you simple and every-day-Go-APIs by using TDD (it looks dull when I say, but it's not).

I hope you enjoy it ;-)
